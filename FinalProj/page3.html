                            The brilliance of Studio Ghibli films are largely attributed to Studio Ghibli's co-founder and director of many of its films - Hayao Miyazaki. Studio Ghibli is well known for its high quality film-making and artistry. Studio Ghibli has revolutionised the way animation has been perceived by audience and the potential animation as a medium as, changing the public's perception of animated movies from merely for children to a medium for all ages through the quality storytelling and animation in many of its films. 

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Miyazaki's films offer audiences a form of escapism in their fantastical worlds, whilst also touching on topics such as environmentalism and relationships, perfectly balancing the spectacle of its fantasy elements with its realism. Miyazaki has truly proven himself to be a phenomenal director and master of space and time with the ability to create empathetic characters. It is no wonder Studio Ghibli's films have captured the hearts of a worldwide audience and developed a loyal audience.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            However, it is not only the story elements that make Studio Ghibli's films a piece of art, but also the deliberate and poetic use of colours. This contribution was given by the talented animator and colour designer - the late Michiyo Yasuda. To quote Michiyo Yasuda 
                        </p>

                            The colour for Kiki's red ribbon has an rgb value of (183, 9, 40). Due to the high number value of red while green and blue are significantly lower, this results in a bright red . Apart from the shadow red, most of the other colours in this scene display are bright due to their high numerical values for all 3 rgb values, but are more desaturated compared to the vibrant red. 
                            <br>

                        <p>This red stands out from numerous scenes in Kiki's delivery service, which leads audiences to look at Kiki whenever she appears on screen and associate her with her famous red ribbon.  The red could also symbolise the passion that and lively attitude that Kiki adopts throughout the movie.

As a result, the numerical values of red, blue and green are not far off from each other. Having 2 of the rgb values be similar compared to the last rgb value would result in a wider range of hues.

                        <p>The colours in Princess Mononoke have been mostly less saturated due to the similar red, green and blue values for each colour. However, there is a wide spectrum of values between different colours, with the brightest colour being (rgb 228, 240, 238) and the darkest colour being (rgb 89, 20, 25).  This colour is also coincidentally the colour with the most saturation as its red value (89) is significantly higher than that of its green and blue values (20 and 25 respectively).

                            In the 1990s, cyberpunk anime rose to popularity with its themes of dystopian futures, advanced technology, and gritty urban environments. These anime explored the relationship between humans and technology, often featuring stories that revolved around hackers, cyborgs, and artificial intelligence.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            90s cyberpunk anime has had a significant impact on science fiction and anime. It introduced a new subgenre of science fiction that explored the relationship between humans and technology in a dystopian society. It highlighted the potential dangers of a future where technology is ubiquitous and can have an adverse impact on human society.Many of the themes explored in 90s cyberpunk anime, such as artificial intelligence, cyborgs, and virtual reality, have become a staple in science fiction and have influenced other media forms such as movies, video games, and literature. This subgenre also explored complex philosophical themes such as the nature of humanity, consciousness, and morality, and challenged the traditional definitions of what it means to be human.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Moreover, 90s cyberpunk anime had a significant impact on the anime industry, as it pushed the boundaries of traditional anime storytelling and animation. It introduced a darker and more mature storytelling style, and the animation was often more detailed and sophisticated, which has set the standard for future anime production.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Overall, the impact of 90s cyberpunk anime can still be felt today, as its influence has transcended its time and has become a part of the cultural zeitgeist.

                            Similar to Kiki's delivery service, the main character, Tetsuo wears a bright red jumpsuit which stands out from the remaining colours in the scene. The red he wears (rgb 227, 56, 54) has a much higher red value than blue or green, resulting in a very saturated and vibrant red. In addition, unlike the blues and greens in the scene for Kiki's Delivery service, the red is contrasted with purples and yellows instead, using the triadic colour scheme.

                        When a powerful hacker known as the Puppet Master begins infiltrating the minds of key government officials and manipulating their thoughts, Major Kusanagi and her team are tasked with tracking down the elusive criminal. As they investigate, they discover that the Puppet Master may not be a criminal at all, but rather a sentient program that has gained self-awareness and is seeking a way to become fully human. As Major Kusanagi delves deeper into the Puppet Master's motives, she begins to question her own existence and what it means to be human in a world where technology and the human mind are becoming increasingly intertwined. The film explores themes of identity, consciousness, and the nature of existence in a rapidly changing world.

                            This scene in Ghost in the shell utlises the analogue colour palette as the main colours of this scene are: blue, green and yellow, which are colours that are next to each other on the colour wheel. This scene is able to encapsulate the general colour tint of the movie, which steers towards blue and green.

These colours are used at the center of the screen, acting as the focal point that our eyes are drawn to. In addition, the colour contrast and the glowing gradient effect of this scene results in a effect that mimics heaven's light, which works in the context of this scene.

                            The main colours in this scene consist of black, purple, blue and bright green as an accent colour, utilising the analogue colour palette, similar to in Ghost in the Shell.  Another similarity for both movies is the presence of a brighter, more saturated colour, which is in this case bright green (rgb 142, 203, 86).

                        <p>Another observation that can be seen in the colours of this scene, is that 2 of the 3 rgb values are closer to each other compared to the third colour, which results in the colours to be more saturated and differentiated from each other, such as the medium purple (99, 75, 149) having the red and green numerical value be closer to each other than the blue value.

                        The main focus of this scene is the brilliant gradient sky during golden hour, which occurs during the climax of the movie. This scene attempts the opposite of the cyberpunk scenes that have been covered, using a silhouette to spotlight the focal point of the scene instead of using a spotlight. Taki and Mitsuha are coloured in with different browns, having low rgb values, as compared to the background with lighter values of above 100.

                        In addition, the colour palette that Is utilised is pastel rather than dark and desaturated, with colours having similarly high rgb values to each other, with one of the rgb values a larger difference compared to the other two rgb values to allow for variation in hues, such as the pastel purple (rgb185, 140, 181). Most of the sunset gradient consisted of an analogue colour scheme of blues and purples, with a stand out accent colour that is complementary in the form of orange (rgb 217, 150, 144).

                        The colour palette of this scene does not follow the conventional colour schemes, rather it features a combination of both browns and pastel blue, pink and green. The contrast can be observed through the rgb values, as observed by how half the colours have very high rgb values, such as pastel pink (rgb 232, 198, 203), compared to the darker brown colours with lower rgb values, such as (rgb 48, 32, 16).

                        This scene from Belle utilises an analogous colour scheme, with its main colours being blue, purple and red, which are next to each other in the colour wheel. The setting of the night sky and the mysterious creature are of a darker to mid value colours, such as dark cyan (33, 68, 88), resulting in lower to mid rgb values. However, Belle has a midtone to pastel colour scheme, consisting of colours of mid to high rgb values such as pastel purple (rgb 225, 185, 234).  This allow for Belle to stand out more in the scene as well as serve the purposes of being the light and hope in the monster's eyes.
