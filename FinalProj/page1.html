                <p>My project involves the analysis of different colour palettes used in Japanese animated films through the different genres. It will consist of colour analysis of the following categories: Studio Ghibli, Cyberpunk Science Fiction, Modern Era Anime films. The website will consist of some background knowledge of colour theory in films and anime, colour palette preference questionnaire and the colour analysis of the websites. 
                    In many visual art mediums, such as film, colours are utilised to emphasise certain emotions and moods. According to Digital Synopsis, colour psychology has often been implemented in films, especially animated ones, to subconsciously evoke specific emotions among the audience. Anime is a highly respected form of animated film, partly due to iconic films such as Spirited Away, Neon Genesis Evangelion and Your Name. By analysing their use of colours and colour theory, we can further understand and apply these skills into future pieces of art and film. </p>

                        <b>Introduction to the use of colours</b>
                    </p>
                    <p>Colour, an understated yet very important aspect of any creative medium. Whether it is film, photography, graphics design, paintings or even a simple drawing with colour pencils. In any artistic, visual medium, colours are used to accentuate different tone, moods and express the emotions that certain scenes are trying to convey in a subtle way. Colours symbolise different emotions and messages, with some colours having different meanings based off the context or characteristics of the colour (saturation, hue) such as:</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Pink - innocence, romance, femininity, beauty</p>
                    <p>Red - love, passion, anger, danger</p> 
                    <p>Orange - humour, warmth, friendliness, youth</p> 
                    <p>Yellow - attention, wisdom, idealisation, naviety</p>   
                    <p>Green - nature, healing, envy, corruption</p>   
                    <p>Blue - isolation, melancholy, calm, spirituality, loyalty</p>   
                    <p>Purple - fantasy, ethereal, mysticism, nobility</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class = "section2">
                <div class= "insertPicture2">
                
                </div>
                <div class= "insertTextbox2">
                    <p>
                        <b>Colour Schemes</b>
                    </p>
                    <p>Most common colour schemes are: </p>
                    <p>Complementary: opposite colours on the colour wheel -> contrast can make imagery stand out</p>
                    <p>Analogue: colours next to each other on the colour wheel -> colour harmony, contains dominate, supporting and accent colours</p>
                    Triadic: evenly spaced around the colour wheel -> visual contrast and harmony </p>

                    <p>
                         <b>Use of RGB values for colour analysis:</b>
                    </p>
                    <p>The RGB colour model is an additive colour model in which the red, green and blue primary colours of light are added together in various ways to reproduce a broad array of colours. RGB values typically consist of 3 main values as well as an additional fourth value indicating opacity. The first value represents the red value, the second represents the green value and the third represents the blue value. The range for all the values are from 0 to 255.  
                    </p>

                    <p>An example of how RGB code is represented is: 
                    <p>White - rgb (255, 255, 255)</p>
                    <p>Black - rgb (0, 0, 0)</p>    
                    <p>Cyan - rgb (0, 100, 100) which is an even mixture of Blue and Green at 100 units</p>    
                    
                </div>
            </div>

                        <b>Introduction to Anime Colours</b>

                    <p>
                        In the colour analysis of anime, the 3 genres that would be compared and contrasted against each other are: Studio Ghibli, 90s Cyberpunk and New Age Anime.  An iconic screenshot from each movie would be chosen for the colour picking process. During this process, the 10 most prominent colours of the screenshot would be selected and converted to its RGB values.  Representative movies from each genre are selected to be used in the analysis:
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Cyberpunk - Akira, Ghost in the Shell, Neon Genesis Evangelion
