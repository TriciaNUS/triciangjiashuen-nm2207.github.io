                <p>My project involves the analysis of different colour palettes used in Japanese animated films through the different genres. It will consist of colour analysis of the following categories: Studio Ghibli, Cyberpunk Science Fiction, Modern Era Anime films. The website will consist of some background knowledge of colour theory in films and anime, colour palette preference questionnaire and the colour analysis of the websites. 
                    In many visual art mediums, such as film, colours are utilised to emphasise certain emotions and moods. According to Digital Synopsis, colour psychology has often been implemented in films, especially animated ones, to subconsciously evoke specific emotions among the audience. Anime is a highly respected form of animated film, partly due to iconic films such as Spirited Away, Neon Genesis Evangelion and Your Name. By analysing their use of colours and colour theory, we can further understand and apply these skills into future pieces of art and film. </p>

                    </p>
                    <p>Colour, an understated yet very important aspect of any creative medium. Whether it is film, photography, graphics design, paintings or even a simple drawing with colour pencils. In any artistic, visual medium, colours are used to accentuate different tone, moods and express the emotions that certain scenes are trying to convey in a subtle way. Colours symbolise different emotions and messages, with some colours having different meanings based off the context or characteristics of the colour (saturation, hue) such as:</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Pink - innocence, romance, femininity, beauty</p>
                    <p>Red - love, passion, anger, danger</p> 
                    <p>Orange - humour, warmth, friendliness, youth</p> 
                    <p>Yellow - attention, wisdom, idealisation, naviety</p>   
                    <p>Green - nature, healing, envy, corruption</p>   
                    <p>Blue - isolation, melancholy, calm, spirituality, loyalty</p>   
                    <p>Purple - fantasy, ethereal, mysticism, nobility</p>
